Thanks to Demonheadge (https://github.com/Demonheadge/pokescape_rom) for creating this awesome project.

HOW TO PLAY:

1) Download and install RetroArch-Win64-setup.exe either from my Releases section (~https://github.com/Conrad-Dugger/PokeScape-Setup/releases/tag/RetroArch-Win64-setup) or from the actual website (~https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms)
2) Once installed, go to Main Menu > Load Core > scroll down and click on "Nintendo - Game Boy Advance (mGBA)"
3) Download PokeScape.gba from my "ROM PokeScape" folder, then save it to a safe folder on your computer
4) In RetroArch, go to Main Menu > Load Content > and then navigate to the folder where you placed PokeScape.gba

Once the game is launched, press F1 for options like saving this ROM as a favorite so you can access it quicker from the RetroArch Favorites tab
