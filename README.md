# PokeScape-Setup
Thanks to Demonheadge (https://github.com/Demonheadge/pokescape_rom) for creating this awesome project.

**HOW TO PLAY:**

	1) Download RetroArch-Win64-setup.exe from my Releases section or from their website (~https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms)
	2) Once Retroarch is installed, go to Main Menu > Load Core > Scroll down and select "Nintendo - Game Boy Advance (mGBA)"
	3) Download PokeScape.gba from my "ROM PokeScape" folder, then save it to a safe folder on your computer
	4) In RetroArch, go to Main Menu > Load Content > and then navigate to the folder where you placed PokeScape.gba

Once the game is launched, press F1 for options like saving this ROM as a favorite so you can access it quicker from the RetroArch Favorites tab
